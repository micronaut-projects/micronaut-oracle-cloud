You can use OCI Application Performance Monitoring (APM) as a drop-in replacement for Tracing in your Micronaut Applications.

OCI APM is a suite of services that give you insight into your applications and servers running in OCI via a small agent that runs on the machine and aggregates and reports metric data.
It's a nice service to monitor and diagnose performance issues.
It also includes a Trace Explorer that is Zipkin (and Jaeger) compatible which we can use from our Micronaut applications (even without taking full advantage of APM via the Java Agent).

=== Create APM Domain

Now, create an APM domain in the OCI console. We'll share a single domain to group and trace all of our services.
That may seem a bit confusing given the name "domain", but think of it more like a "project group" or an "environment" (you may want to create separate domains for QA, Test, Prod, etc.).
Search for `Application Performance Monitoring` and click `Administration`.

In the left sidebar, click `APM Domains`.

Click `Create APM Domain`.

Name it, choose a compartment, and enter a description.

image::oci_console_create_apm_domain_details.png[Create APM Domain Details]

Once the domain is created, view the domain details.
Here you'll need to grab a few values, so copy the data upload endpoint (#1), private key (#2), and public key (#3).

image::oci_console_apm_domain_details.png[Create APM Domain]

Now we have what we need to construct a URL to plug in to our application config files.
The `Collector URL` format requires us to construct a URL by using the `data upload endpoint` as our base URL and generate the path based on some choices including values from our private or public key.
The format is https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/application-performance-monitoring/doc/configure-open-source-tracing-systems.html#APMGN-GUID-B5EDE254-C854-436D-B844-B986A4E077AA[documented here].
Once we've constructed the URL path, we can add it to our `application-oraclecloud.yml` config.

.Example Oracle Cloud Config
[source,yml]
----
micronaut:
  application:
    name: demo2
tracing:
  zipkin:
    enabled: true
    sampler:
      probability: 1
    http:
      url: https://[redacted].apm-agt.us-phoenix-1.oci.oraclecloud.com
      path: /20200101/observations/public-span?dataFormat=zipkin&dataFormatVersion=2&dataKey=[public key]
    supportsJoin: false
----

If you want to keep these values out of the config file, you could set them as environment variables on the server like so:

.Set ENV vars
[source,bash]
----
export TRACING_ZIPKIN_HTTP_URL="https://[redacted].apm-agt.us-phoenix-1.oci.oraclecloud.com" export TRACING_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PATH="/20200101/observations/public-span?dataFormat=zipkin&dataFormatVersion=2&dataKey=[public key]"
----

Your application will now send trace information to APM.

=== View Trace Data in APM

Go to the APM Trace Explorer in the OCI console.

image::oci_console_trace_explorer.png[APM Trace Explorer]

Choose your APM domain in the top right and the time period that you'd like to view/search.

image::oci_console_trace_explorer_choose_domain.png[APM Trace Explorer Choose Domain]

Choose one of the available pre-configured queries across the top.

image::oci_console_trace_explorer_choose_query.png[APM Trace Explorer Choose Query]

View traces and spans:

image::oci_console_trace_explorer_traces.png[APM Trace Explorer Traces]

Click a trace to view detailed info.

image::oci_console_trace_explorer_trace_details.png[APM Trace Explorer Trace Details]

Click a span inside a trace to view detailed info and tagged values.
