To get started quickly, https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm[setup the Oracle Cloud CLI] making sure you have run `oci setup config` to configure local access to Oracle Cloud.

Then add dependencies on the Micronaut OracleCloud modules corresponding to OCI SDK clients you wish to use, for example Vault:

dependency:io.micronaut.oraclecloud:micronaut-oraclecloud-bmc-vault[]

Utilize Micronaut Injection to get an instance of the client in your application, e.g.:
```java
@Inject
Vault vault
```

All OCI SDK clients are supported.
