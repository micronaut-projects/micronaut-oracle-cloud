In addition to the blocking clients, this module provides clients that use RxJava to allow reactive programming with Micronaut for each SDK.

NOTE: You need to add the relevant OCI SDK dependency to use these clients.

For example, instead of `ObjectStorageClient`, you can inject `ObjectStorageRxClient` to use the Object Storage API:

snippet::example.BucketController[project-base="docs-examples/example", source="main", tags="imports,class"]

<1> The `ObjectStorageRxClient` is injected into the constructor.

Once you have a reference to the relevant RxJava 2 client it is easier to compose non-blocking operations, the following example creates a bucket:

snippet::example.BucketController[project-base="docs-examples/example", source="main", tags="method", indent="0"]

<1> First a request to obtain the namespace is sent
<2> Then with the response the `flatMap` operator is used to send another request to create a bucket
<3> Finally the location of the bucket is returned in the response
